Singleton classes - for any java class if we are allow to create only one object such type of class is called singleton class.
wx - Runtime,

Advantage -
1) If several people have same requirement then it is not recomanded to a seperate object for every requirement
   we have to create only one object and we can re-use the same object for similar requirement.
2) Performance
3) Memory utilization

# create only one object and give to all whose have similar requirement
- Java provides Runtime class
Runtime r1= Runtime.getRuntime();
Runtime r2= Runtime.getRuntime();
Runtime r1L= Runtime.getRuntime();

# How to create our own singleton class?
- Use private constuctor
- Private static variable
- public factory method

-------------------------------------------
Approch 1) Create object at bigning - Factory approch

public class Test {

private static Test t = new Test(); //Obeject create

private Test(){

}

public static Test getTest(){
return t;
}
}

ex - Runtime class internally implemented using this approch.

-------------------------------------------
Approch 2) Create object when it required 1st time and use for all

public class Test {

private static Test t = null;

private Test(){

}

public static Test getTest(){
if( t == null){
t = new Test();
}
return t;
}
}

-------------------------------------------
q) How it is possible? when class is not final but we are not allow to create child class?
-  BY declear every class private we can restrict child class creation.
public class Test {

private Test(){

}
}

class child1 extends Test{

}

CTE - implicit super constructor Test() is not visible for default constructor. Must define an explicit constructor

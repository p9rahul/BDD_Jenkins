Hello Jam,
I am writing regarding the issues we have seen having with our database system.
Both clients and staff have been experiencing severe problems for several days now. We are unable to update records or access information on customer interactions. This is costing us large amounts of money, both in time spent trying to fix the problem, and in lost sales.

Hello jam,
I am concerned about the number of sick days staff have been taking recently.
Staff in the IT department have taken a total of 44 sick days so far this month, compared to total of 23 for last month, and just 18 for the previous month, this is affecting productivity, and also placing a lot of stress on the employees who do come to work.

Now changing the topic and add another topic
There is one more thing I would like to discuss with you. It seems like the number of customer complaints has been increased for three months……

-----------------------------------

Ex – 
Please arrange a meeting of all department heads by tomorrow at the latest.
As a matter of urgency, you need to contact all the clients who may have been affected by this issue.

# But when is not that urgent
-	Could you please …. Talk to team and clarify our options on this? 
-	I would like you to ….inform staff about the new policies.

#Less direct
I suggest that you contact all clients who may have been affected by the data breach.
Can I ask you to inform staff about the new policies?
-	This does not require any immediate response, but keep eye on the situation.
